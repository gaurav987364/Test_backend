# Setup 

install MongoDB shell, Compass & also setup atlas tool for online;

#mongod -v
#mongosh  (in terminal)

check for databases & collections

show dbs, show collections, use DbName, DbName.createCollection('collectionName'), DbName.dropDatabase(), DbName.collectionName.drop();


CRUD in MongoDb:-

#read opr.

db.collectionName.find({})   //find all objects;
db.collectionName.find({}).limit(1)   //find one;
db.collectionName.find({}).size()   //find length of collection;


#Create opr.

db.collectionName.insertMany([
    {},
    {},
    {},
])  // insert many documents

db.collectionName.insertOne({}) // insert only one document.

26. **Find products with the highest review count in each category**
27. **Calculate average inventory across all warehouses for each product**
28. **Find the top 3 most reviewed products with rating above 4.0**

30. **Group products by price range (0-50, 51-500, 501-1000, 1000+) and count**

## Complex Aggregation Operations

31. **Calculate the weighted average rating considering review distribution (multiply each star count by star number)**
32. **Find products where available inventory is less than 20% of total stock**
33. **Calculate seasonal demand score (create a formula using the seasonalDemand object)**

## MongoDB Operators & Functions

36. **Use $regex to find products with "Pro" in their name**
37. **Use $exists to find products that have seasonalDemand data**
38. **Use $size to find products with exactly 3 varieties in contents array**
39. **Use $elemMatch to find products with storage capacity greater than 1000GB**
40. **Use $addFields to calculate discount percentage from MSRP to current price**

## Date Operations

41. **Find products updated in the last 30 days**
42. **Calculate how many days since each product was created**
43. **Find products with reviews posted in July 2024**
44. **Group products by creation month and count them**
45. **Find products with active seasonal discounts that end before September 2024**

## Update Operations

46. **Increase the current price of all electronics by 5%**
47. **Add a new tag "bestseller" to products with rating > 4.5**
48. **Update inventory for productId "PROD-001" - reduce available by 5**
49. **Add a new review to a product**
50. **Set all products without free shipping to have expeditedAvailable: false**

## Indexing & Performance

51. **Create compound index on category.primary and pricing.current**
52. **Create text index on name and description fields**
53. **Create index on reviews.averageRating for sorting queries**
54. **Analyze query performance using explain() for category searches**
55. **Create sparse index on seasonalDemand field**

## Mongoose-Specific Questions

56. **Design a Mongoose schema for the product document structure**
57. **Create validation rules for required fields and data types**
58. **Implement pre-save middleware to automatically update `updatedAt`**
59. **Create virtual properties for calculating profit margin and discount percentage**
60. **Implement static methods for finding featured products**
61. **Create instance methods for checking if product is in stock**
62. **Design population strategy for nested warehouse data**
63. **Implement custom validators for price ranges and inventory levels**

## Advanced MongoDB Features

## Query Difficulty Levels:
- **Beginner (1-20)**: Basic find, simple filters, basic aggregation
- **Intermediate (21-45)**: Complex aggregation, nested queries, arrays
- **Advanced (46-60)**: Updates, indexing, performance optimization
- **Expert (61-75)**: Mongoose features, advanced MongoDB operations

## Tips for Practice:
1. Start with basic queries and gradually increase complexity
2. Practice writing both MongoDB shell syntax and Mongoose syntax
3. Focus on understanding aggregation pipeline stages
4. Experiment with different indexing strategies
5. Always consider query performance and optimization
6. Practice error handling and validation scenarios
